## RECOMMENDED

* Markdown filter (https://www.drupal.org/project/markdown):
  When enabled, display of the project's README.md help will be rendered
  with markdown.


## INSTALLATION
 
* Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
  https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for
  further information.

* You may want to disable Toolbar module, since its output clashes with
  Administration Menu.


## FAQ

Q: I enabled "Aggregate and compress CSS files", but admin_menu.css is still
   there. Is this normal?

A: Yes, this is the intended behavior. the administration menu module only loads
   its stylesheet as needed (i.e., on page requests by logged-on, administrative
   users).
